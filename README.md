## Overview

Welcome to the Lunar Lander Reinforcement Learning project! This repository contains code, documentation, and resources related to training a reinforcement learning agent to navigate the challenging task of lunar descent using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. The trained agent learns to make navigational decisions that enable a spacecraft to safely land on the lunar surface.

## Project Introduction

This project is dedicated to exploring reinforcement learning techniques in the context of lunar landing. The objective is to train an agent to control a lunar lander's actions to ensure a successful landing. By implementing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, we enable the agent to learn effective strategies for safe descent.

## Setup and Dependencies

To set up the development environment and install the required dependencies, follow the instructions in the [Setup Guide](docs/setup-guide.md).

## Virtual Display and Environment Initialization

Learn how a virtual display is utilized for headless operation and how the "LunarLander-v2" environment is initialized using the `gym` library in the [Virtual Display and Environment Initialization](docs/virtual-display-and-environment.md) guide.

## Exploring the Environment

Explore the process of taking random actions in the environment and observing the outcomes in the [Exploring the Environment](docs/exploring-environment.md) guide.

## Observation and Action Spaces

Understand the observation and action spaces within the "LunarLander-v2" environment and how they shape the agent's interactions in the [Observation and Action Spaces](docs/observation-action-spaces.md) guide.

## PPO Algorithm Configuration

Dive into the configuration of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, including policy, environment, hyperparameters, and more in the [PPO Algorithm Configuration](docs/ppo-configuration.md) guide.

## Training the PPO Agent

Learn how the PPO agent is trained for a specified number of timesteps and how the trained model is saved for future use in the [Training the PPO Agent](docs/training-ppo-agent.md) guide.

## Evaluating the Trained Agent

Discover how the trained agent's performance is evaluated using the evaluation environment, and how the mean and standard deviation of rewards are calculated in the [Evaluating the Trained Agent](docs/evaluating-trained-agent.md) guide.

## Sharing the Model on Hugging Face

Explore the process of packaging and sharing the trained PPO model using Hugging Face's model hub in the [Sharing the Model on Hugging Face](docs/sharing-on-hugging-face.md) guide.
